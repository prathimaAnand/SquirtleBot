Code description:
This is a Python script for a ROS node that tracks AprilTag detections, stores the best poses in the map frame and publishes the transforms for those poses. It does this by subscribing to two topics, one for the AprilTag detections and another for cmd_vel (command velocity). The node receives AprilTag detections and transforms the poses into the map frame using a TransformListener. It also receives cmd_vel and uses it to calculate a velocity score. It updates the best pose for a tag if the new detection has a higher velocity score than the previous best. The node also publishes the known tag transforms to the ROS system.
