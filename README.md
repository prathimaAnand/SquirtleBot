# SquirtleBot - TurtleBot Reconnaissance Mission
In this project, a simulation of a disaster environment was implemented using a TurtleBot3 hardware. The robot was used to survey the area by mapping its trajectory also the area and identify potential dangers and victims. The project demonstrated the efficiency of using a robot to map an area and identify hazards and injured people before sending human responders into the field. The performance of the mover_base and explore_lite packages were modified using ROS and Python in order to improve the robot's capabilities in terms of reliability and precision.
